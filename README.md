# Mortality Rate Analysis
IS590PR Spring 2019. 

## Summary
The reason leading to the death of an individual differs depending on the surroundings and kind of lifestyle followed over a period of time. The number of deaths is used as the ranking criterion because it most accurately reflects the frequency of cause-specific mortality. Cause-of-death ranking is a popular method of presenting mortality statistics and is a useful tool for illustrating the relative burden of cause-specific mortality, but it must be used cautiously with a clear understanding of the limitations underlying the method.

The reason can be varied- from genetic disorder to factors like accidents, lack of proper healthcare facility, poverty, pollution in air and water, and many more. 

Despite all healthcare facilities present today, we can see that several counties have a high mortality rate. These numbers are surprisingly high, despite the fact that the United States has the best healthcare facility in the world. This disturbing number may also be related to genetic defects or other factors as mentioned.

These factors also include unhealthy lifestyle choices, genetic disorders or due to the inaccessible health care facility, for which the reasons are unknown. For profoundly understanding the reasons and depicting why different states in the US have different mortality rates, we try to analyze the Community Health Status Indicators (CHSI) dataset. This dataset provides detailed data of mortality rate on basis of Demographic factors, Leading causes of deaths, infant mortality rates due to unavoidable factors, a population vulnerable to fatal diseases and how the quality of air has been a contributing factor. This report contains over 200 measures for each of the 3,141 United States counties.

We intend to demonstrate the leading factors for deaths in any county in The United States for the year 2010.

## Hypothesis:

While considering the above factors and scenarios, we intend to perform descriptive analysis and understand the major causes of deaths across 3141 counties in The The United States. To understand this, have come up with the following hypothesis:

1. It has been observed that the mortality rate among individuals of diverse ethnic backgrounds and race is disturbingly varying. This means that individuals from different ethnic backgrounds and races do not have equal access to medical facilities and are prone to fatal diseases.

2. Pollution and genetic defects have been the leading causes of cancer and major respiratory diseases. In addition to this drug abuse, smoking and unhealthy lifestyle choices have been major contributing factors in increasing mortality rate.

3. The mortality rate in states with higher poverty index and higher risk factors are greater as compared to the ones with lower risk factors.

## Results

For the first hypothesis, our analysis is as follows:

• It is clear that the states with higher mortality rate have a higher black and Hispanic population whereas the states with lower death percentage have higher white and other race population.
• It is clear from the graph that poverty ratio is generally random for all the races in all the counties.
• However, as the population of white people is generally greater than other races population, poverty in white people is slightly
greater than the other population.
• According to the analysis based on states, it is clear that poverty ratio is generally higher in states with the more white population.

It can be clearly seen that the mortality rate among the different races or ethnic groups are disturbingly varying due to various factors involved and can be concluded that the hypothesis holds true.


For the second hypothesis, our analysis is as follows:

• It can be observed that the mortality rates due to birth defects are higher and can be observed to be higher for White in every county.
• In addition to this, we can see that the AQI i.e Air quality index is a major contributing factor in understanding the trend in cases of lung cancer among the people in different counties.
• The higher AQI value corresponds to the total number of unhealthy days in that particular county.
• Also, higher value of factors such as particles per million for toxic checmicals and AQI both contribute majorly towards increaase mortality rate due to different types of cancer, namely Lung, colon, breast,etc.
• Also,a trend in the deaths due to unhealthy lifestyle choices has been a contributing factor in increasing mortality rates in different states.

In all, it can be concluded that the second hypothses holds true for all the factors stated above.

For the third hypothesis, our analysis is as follows:

• In some cases, the mortality rate is higher in places where the poverty index is higher and lower in the states where
the poverty index is lower. However, after in-depth analysis of the result, we found out that this trend is notconsistent throughout the resultant data.
• Also in addition to this we assumed that the mortality rate depends directly on various risk factors like
obesity , diabetes, smoking, etc.
• The analysis based on other risk factors also shows that the trend is not consistent throughout the data.

We can say that this hypothesis holds true only to the higher values(based on sorting done) and then becomes inconsistent as we progress through the data.
