# Mortality Rate Analysis
IS590PR Spring 2019. 

## Summary
The reason leading to the death of an individual differs depending on the surroundings and kind of lifestyle followed over a period of time. The number of deaths is used as the ranking criterion because it most accurately reflects the frequency of cause-specific mortality. Cause-of-death ranking is a popular method of presenting mortality statistics and is a useful tool for illustrating the relative burden of cause-specific mortality, but it must be used cautiously with a clear understanding of the limitations underlying the method.

The reason can be varied- from genetic disorder to factors like accidents, lack of proper healthcare facility, poverty, pollution in air and water, and many more. 

Despite all healthcare facilities present today, we can see that several counties have a high mortality rate. These numbers are surprisingly high, despite the fact that the United States has the best healthcare facility in the world. This disturbing number may also be related to genetic defects or other factors as mentioned.

These factors also include unhealthy lifestyle choices, genetic disorders or due to the inaccessible health care facility, for which the reasons are unknown. For profoundly understanding the reasons and depicting why different states in the US have different mortality rates, we try to analyze the Community Health Status Indicators (CHSI) dataset. This dataset provides detailed data of mortality rate on basis of Demographic factors, Leading causes of deaths, infant mortality rates due to unavoidable factors, a population vulnerable to fatal diseases and how the quality of air has been a contributing factor. This report contains over 200 measures for each of the 3,141 United States counties.

We intend to demonstrate the leading factors for deaths in any county in The United States for the year 2010.

## Hypothesis:

While considering the above factors and scenarios, we intend to perform descriptive analysis and understand the major causes of deaths across 3141 counties in The The United States. To understand this, have come up with the following hypothesis:

1. It has been observed that the mortality rate among individuals of diverse ethnic backgrounds and race is disturbingly varying. This means that individuals from different ethnic backgrounds and races do not have equal access to medical facilities and are prone to fatal diseases.

2. Pollution and genetic defects have been the leading causes of cancer and major respiratory diseases. In addition to this drug abuse, smoking and unhealthy lifestyle choices have been major contributing factors in increasing mortality rate.

3. The mortality rate in states with higher poverty index and higher risk factors are greater as compared to the ones with lower risk factors.
